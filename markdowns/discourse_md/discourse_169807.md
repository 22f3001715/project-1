  <p>Hi Carlton,<br>
  I am writing to confirm the basic requirements for successfully completing the course.</p>
  <p>As I understand, the criteria for passing are:</p>
  <ol>
  <li>Achieving a score greater than 40 marks in the graded assignments.</li>
  <li>Securing more than 40 marks in the end-term examination.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Could you kindly confirm if this understanding is accurate? Additionally, please let me know if there are any other prerequisites to be met.</p>
