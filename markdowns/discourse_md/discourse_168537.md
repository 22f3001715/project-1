  <p>On 2nd March, I have both Java OPPE and TDS ROE.<br>
  My Java OPPE timing is: 9:30 to 11:00 AM<br>
  MY TDS ROE timing is: 10:30 to 11:15 AM</p>
  <p>A minimum gap of one hour is recommended.</p>
  <p>I have written to support.</p>

  <p>Apologies for the confusion. I realized that the issue was due to different time zones—Java OPPE displayed IST (GMT +5:30), while TDS ROE showed AST (GMT +3). On the same day, I intended to delete my post on Discourse but couldn’t find it, as it was still in draft mode. So, I deleted it. However, I was surprised to see the post today.</p>
  <p>I regret any inconvenience caused.</p>
